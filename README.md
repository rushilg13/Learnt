# Learnt!

We plan on using knowledge as a commodity. We are planning on using it to exchange skills between 2 people. Suppose a person A knows React and wants to learn NodeJs and a person B knows NodeJs and wants to learn React. So we plan on connecting such people who will help each other out to learn a new skill in return of teaching a skill. The website will connect and can also use an in-built chatting platform. The platform can be used to solve doubts and also learn a new skill. People can choose domains that are good in while registering on website. It can also have a recommendation system to help someone proceed better with next technology they can learn. Most importantly, This platform is free and will provide quality education to all making it accessible to a wider audience. <br>
