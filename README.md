# Learnt!

MatchED acts as a matchmaker for users who are both learners and teachers. Two users will be matched such that the topic user-A wants to learn is the topic user-B knows and vice versa. It will help people learn and grow together. A user can get a guide/teacher free of cost. The platform can also be used to solve doubts. <br>

Our project uses knowledge as a commodity. It will allow people to exchange skills between them. Suppose a person A knows React and wants to learn NodeJs and a person B knows NodeJs and wants to learn React. So we plan on connecting such people who will help each other out to learn a new skill in return of teaching a skill. The website will connect and can also use an in-built chatting platform. People can choose domains that are good in while registering on website. It can also have a recommendation system to help someone proceed better with next technology they can learn. Most importantly, This platform is free and will provide quality education to all making it accessible to a wider audience.<br>

In brief, we wanted to build a platform where a person can find a guide/teacher by using their own teaching skills as a commodity. Furthermore, they can build good relationships with their partners and make connections that will help them in the future.<br>

We have also planned to make an app which will make the communication between our users much better. An Machine Learning algorithm will also be implemented for recommending partners to users. We will also establish a rating system, so that a user can be judged on the basis of their teaching skills. <br>
